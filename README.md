# reinforce-with-ppo-pingpong
Implementation of REINFORCE and Proximal-Policy-Optimization to solve ping-pong from pixels

## Part of non-graded tasks at Udacity Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree

REINFORCE algoritmh takes a proud second place in the competition "Most mathematically obscured paper with simplest implementation".

All the REINFORCE trick in derivation, all the smarts thing said boils to a torch.log(probs) * reward...


First place ethernally belongs to Wasserstein GAN.
